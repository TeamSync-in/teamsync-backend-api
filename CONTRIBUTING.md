## üìè Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Style

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **semicolons** at the end of statements
- Use **single quotes** for strings
- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and interfaces
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants

### File Organization

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services**: Contain business logic
- **Models**: Define database schemas
- **Utils**: Helper functions
- **Middlewares**: Express middleware functions
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for input validation

### Error Handling

- Use custom error classes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Log errors appropriately

### Security Best Practices

- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries
- Sanitize user input
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## üìù Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process, dependencies, etc.

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add Google OAuth integration
fix(tasks): resolve task deletion permission issue
docs(api): update authentication endpoints documentation
refactor(controllers): extract common validation logic
test(services): add unit tests for workspace service
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with conventional commit messages

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Pull Request Template

When creating a pull request, please include:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Description** of what was changed and why
- **Testing** information (how was it tested?)
- **Screenshots** (if UI changes)
- **Breaking changes** (if any)
